              <p>
                  A short 45-minute flight from Addis Ababa to Bahir Dar lies one of East Africa's most prominent natural jewels, Lake Tana. 84 km long, 66 km wide, 15 meters deep, Lake Tana is the largest lake in Ethiopia. The Blue Nile, a major tributary to the world's largest river, the great Nile, starts its journey from Lake Tana (and flows down the impressive Blue Nile Falls). 
                  
                  Some of the world's s oldest churches and monasteries can be found on some of Tana's 37 islands and peninsulas, the most famous being the Kebran Gabriel. Believed to be built in the 14th century, this ancient church contains a museum with old paintings and manuscripts. Note that only men can enter and visit this monastery, and at the time of writing it is no longer open to the public.
                  Lake
                  Not as popular as the Kebran Gabriel but certainly the most attractive church in the Lake Tana region is the Ura Kidane Mehret. Founded by Saint Betre Maryiam, this 14th-century church has a stunning interior ornamented with frescos of the then ruler of the Gojjam province, Tekle Haymanot. Unlike the Kebran Gabriel, all genders are permissible to enter and visit, and the church is open to the public.
                  
                  Lake Tana is also known for its selection of fish, of which more than 70% are endemic to the lake. Birds are also found aplenty around the lake. Recognizing its natural and cultural importance, UNESCO welcomed Lake Tana to its Biosphere Reserve list in 2015.

              p>Lake Ziway is a freshwater lake that is located on the border between the Oromia Region and the Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples' Region, about 100 kilometres south of the country's capital, Addis Ababa.
          
              Lake Ziway contains 5 islands dispersed on its freshwater surface, the largest being Tulu Gudo. Legend has it that this island was the hiding place of the Ark of the Covenant, the powerful relic King Menelik I brought to Ethiopia in the 4th Century. Then in the 10th Century, when Queen Gudit, the then ruler of Axum, threatened to destroy the relic as part of her crusade to annihilate the rulers of the Axumite dynasty, the Zay people brought the relic to Tulu Gudo, and it remained here for about 70 years before being returned to its home, Axum. 
              
              Ziway is also known for its prolific birdlife and hippopotamuses. If you're spending time in the Rift Valley, we recommend booking on a boat ride around the lake to explore the wildlife under the expert guidance of local fishermen</p>

              <p>3 hours south of the capital lies Lake Langano, an idyllic lake perfect for a night or two of relaxation during a longer tour of the country. 

                  Just to the east of Lake Langano is the Langano Nature Reserve. This forest is filled with a wide variety of birds and mammals, with some being endemic to Ethiopia. Baboons, hippos, and warthogs are a common sight at this lakeside forest. Two neighbouring eco lodges on the far side of the lake loan modern mountain bikes, so you can explore the network of trails that wind through the lake’s nearby forest.
                  
                  Langano is one of the principal swimming harbours for the locals. Tourists also come here from all over the world to either sail or waterski in the soft brown waters of Langano. Some swim, while others lie in the blazing sun on the sandy shore of the lake.
                  
                  The Wabi Shebele and Bekele Mola Hotels can be found on the western shores of the Lake, offering decent lakeside beaches, whilst the Bishangari and Sabana Lodges offer the best value for money. We’ll always select the accommodation that’s right for you.

                  One of the best lakes to fish in Ethiopia, Lake Awassa is located 270 km to the south of Addis Ababa, and is the smallest of the Rift Valley Lakes.
                  
                  With beautiful views, come beautiful hotels. There are many luxury resorts built around the lake, with Haile Resort Awassa being our favourite. The hotel is owned by the famous Ethiopian athlete Haile Gebrselassie.

                  Lake Abaya is famous amongst birdwatchers. A breadth of bird species are found here, with white pelicans, black heron, and bright pink flamingos amongst the most common sightings. 
                  
                  Located just south of Lake Abaya is Lake Chamo. With a catchment area of about 18,000 sq km and a depth of only 10 meters, this lake is known for its large population of crocodiles.

            <p>Yabelo Wildlife Sanctuary is a protected area and wildlife sanctuary in southern Ethiopia. It is located in the Borena Zone of the Oromia Region west of the town of Yabelo, having an area of 2,500 square kilometers and elevations ranging from 1430 to 2000 meters above sea level. The wildlife sanctuary borders on Borana National Park to the south <br>
            The area of the sanctuary is notable for its red soils which have little organic matter. The general vegetation-type is Acacia savanna, the major trees being A. drepanolobium on black cotton soil, and A. brevispica and A. horrida on the slopes. There are also patches of Balanites aegyptiaca, and several species of Commiphora and Terminalia at the lower altitudes. The higher parts of the hills were formerly covered with forest dominated by Juniperus procera and Olea europaea cuspidata <br>
            Burchell's zebras are known to be abundant within the sanctuary along with small populations of Gerenuks, Grant's Gazelles, Beisa oryxes, and Günther's dik-diks.[3] The park also provides a suitable habitat for Beisa oryx, Bohor reedbuck, bushpig, Ethiopian hare, Greater kudu, Lesser kudu, and warthog. Carnivores including lion, leopard, cheetah, African wild dog, golden jackal, serval cat, side-striped jackal, spotted hyena, and Olive baboons.

            <p>If you travel to the east of Ethiopia, you will find the Shebelle river. The name “Shebelle” springs from a Somali word Webi Shabeellex which means “tiger” or “leopard”. The Shebelle stream originates from the highlands of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia and flows into the African nation, wherever it becomes a seasonal body of water, as an alternative rising and disappearing at totally different times of the year.  The stream covers a distance of 702 miles creating it the fourth-longest stream in the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia. The Shebelle stream has each seasonal and permanent tributary. Together with the Erestream, Galetti stream, and Wabe stream.

                The stream is encircled by a sacred enclosure that’s jungly with juniper trees. The region through that the Shebeli flows is occupied by Somalis, Bantu-speaking folks, and Oromo. Cultivation has, for the most part, replaced pastoral nomadism within the river’s lower basin, and therefore the bananas fully grown on the southern reaches of the Shebeli, and therefore the Jubba compose an oversized portion of Somalia’s export trade.
