          <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-12"><h3>Coffea Arabica</h3>
            <p>Coffea arabica, also known as the Arabic coffee, is a species of flowering plant in the coffee and madder family Rubiaceae. It is believed to be the first species of coffee to have been cultivated and is currently the dominant cultivar, representing about 60% of global production. Coffee produced from the less acidic, more bitter, and more highly caffeinated robusta bean (C. canephora) makes up most of the remaining coffee production. Arabica coffee originates from and was first cultivated in Yemen, and documented by the 12th century. 
                Endemic to the southwestern highlands of Ethiopia, Coffea arabica is now rare in Ethiopia, while many populations appear to be of mixed native and planted trees. Coffea arabica is today grown in dozens of countries between the Tropic of Capricorn and the Tropic of Cancer. It is commonly used as an understorey shrub. It has also been recovered from the Boma Plateau in South Sudan. Coffea arabica is also found on Mount Marsabit in northern Kenya, but it is unclear whether this is a truly native or naturalised occurrence; recent studies support it being naturalised. The species is widely naturalised in areas outside its native land, in many parts of Africa, Latin America, Southeast Asia, India, China, and assorted islands in the Caribbean and in the Pacific.

                The coffee tree was first brought to Hawaii in 1813, and it began to be extensively grown by about 1850. It was formerly more widely grown than at present, especially in Kona, and it persists after cultivation in many areas. In some valleys, it is a highly invasive weed. In the Udawattakele and Gannoruwa Forest Reserves near Kandy, Sri Lanka, coffee shrubs are also a problematic invasive species.

                Coffee has been produced in Queensland and New South Wales of Australia, starting in the 1980s and 90s. The Wet Tropics Management Authority has classified Coffea arabica as an environmental weed for southeast Queensland due to its invasiveness in non-agricultural areas

            <p>
                Eragrostis tef, also known as teff, Williams lovegrass or annual bunch grass, is an annual grass, a species of lovegrass native to the Horn of Africa, notably to both Eritrea and Ethiopia. It is cultivated for its edible seeds, also known as teff. Teff was one of the earliest plants domesticated. It is one of the most important staple crops in Ethiopia and Eritrea.
                Teff is mainly cultivated in Ethiopia and Eritrea, where it originates. It is one of the most important staple crops in these two countries, where it is used to make injera or Tayta. In 2016, Ethiopia grew more than 90 percent of the world's teff. It is now also marginally cultivated in India, Australia, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, and the US, particularly in Idaho, California, Texas, and Nevada. Because of its very small seeds, a handful is enough to sow a large area. This property makes teff particularly suited to a seminomadic lifestyle.

            <p>Ensete ventricosum, commonly known as enset or ensete, Ethiopian banana, Abyssinian banana, pseudo-banana, false banana and wild banana, is an herbaceous species of flowering plant in the banana family Musaceae. The domesticated form of the plant is cultivated only in Ethiopia, where it provides the staple food for approximately 20 million people. The name Ensete ventricosum was first published in the Kew Bulletin 1947, p. 101. Its synonyms include Musa arnoldiana De Wild., Musa ventricosa Welw. and Musa ensete J. F. Gmelin. In its wild form, it is native to the eastern edge of the Great African Plateau, extending northwards from South Africa through Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Malawi, Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania to Ethiopia, and west to the Congo, being found in high-rainfall forests on mountains, and along forested ravines and streams

                Coccinia abyssinica is an Ethiopian species of Coccinia which was first described by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck. The tuber is under its Oromo name anchote a well-known local crop, but also the leaves are eaten. <br>
                Widespread in the highlands of Ethiopia between 1300 and 2800 m.Along lake shores, in forest clearings and degraded forests, evergreen shrublands. Cultivated. Flowering between June and October.Coccinia abyssinica tubers are an important staple crop in the Ethiopian highlands. The tubers are rich in starch and are cooked. Also the young shoots and the leaves are cooked and eaten around Dembi Dolo, Oromia State. There are also beliefs about medical use, but none is scientifically verified so far. The relatively high content of calcium might be the reason for the local belief that eating C. abyssinica helps against fractured bones. The edibility of the fruits is disputed, eventually, there are different races.

                Niger seeds are used for human consumption in the southern parts of India. In Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra, niger seeds are used to make a dry chutney, which is used as an accompaniment with breads such as chapati. They are also used as a spice in some curries. In Ethiopia, an infusion made from roasted and ground niger seeds, sugar and water is used in treating common colds.

            <p>Endemic to Ethiopia, Walia Ibex, formerly widespread in the northern mountain massifs, but now restricted to the Simien Mountains National Park, where it is uncommon but quite often seen by hikers.

                The Walia Ibex is a type of goat that lives on narrow mountain edges and can be recognized by the large curved horns of adults of both sexes. However, the males&#39 horns are larger than the females&#39 and may measure in excess of one meter. The presence of carved shrines in Yeha and Axum indicate that it was once considerably more widespread than it is today

            <p>Ethiopia&#39s one fully endemic antelope species is the Mountain Nyala (Tragelaphus Buxtoni). The mountain Nyala is similar in size and shape to the Greater Kudu but it has smaller horns with only one twist as opposed to the greater Kudu&#39s two or three. The shaggy coat of the Mountain Nyala is brownish rather than plain grey, and the striping is indistinct. This elegant and handsome antelope live in herds of five to ten animals in juniper and hagenia forests in the southeast highland.

                The Mountain Nyala has the distinction of being the last discovered of all African antelopes, the first documented specimen was shout by one Major Buxton in 1908 and described formally two years later. The main protected population is found in the northern part of Bale Mountains National Park, around Dinsho, the Bale Mountains National Park headquarters and Mount Gaysay.

            <p>Belonging to the same family as the Mountain Nyala, the Bushbuck shares with them the family characteristic of shy and elusive behavior. Over forty races of Bushbuck have been identified, which vary considerably both from the point of view of coloration and from the type of habitat they frequent. Most of them are forest living animals inhabiting dense bush, usually near water, though this is not an essential, as some of them have been known to go without drinking for long periods when necessary. No accurate estimate has been made of their total population because of their nocturnal and furtive habits. Like the Mountain Nyala, they are easier to observe in the Bale Mountains National Park where they are fully protected and therefore a little less shy.

          <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-12"><h3>Ethiopian Wolf</h3>
            <p>This beautiful animal was once widespread over the Ethiopian plateau lands and was often observed by travelers with its fine red coat shining in the sun, making it easy to spot against the greens and browns of the grasslands. Its frightening decline in numbers is due not only to indiscriminate shooting, but also to outbreaks of rabies, which certainly decimated its numbers in the Simien area. In this part of Ethiopia it is now extremely rare, even rarer than the Walia Ibex, but it has another stronghold, in Bale, which the Walia doesn&#39t. Its restriction to these two areas is not fully understood, as it is not considered that it was so extensively hunted throughout its range that it should have been unable to survive in the thousands of hectares of suitable “fox country” available.

                It is one of most beautiful and spectacular members of the dog family in the world, with its bright rufous coat, white under markings and black tail, stands about 60cm high making it significantly larger than any Jackal, and has along muzzle similar to that of a Coyote. It has predominantly. It is a diurnal hunter of Afro - alpine moorland and short grassland, where its feeds mostly on rodents including the giant mole rat.

          <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-12"><h3>Gelada Baboon</h3>
            <p>The striking and unmistakable most common of Ethiopia&#39s endemic large mammal species, with a population estimated by some to be as high as 700,000. The male Gelada is a spectacular handsome and unmistakable beast, possessed of an imposing golden mane and heart shaped red chest patch, which serve the same purpose as the colorful buttocks or testicles found on those African monkeys that don&#39t spend most of their lives sitting on their bums. The Gelada is the only mammal&#39s endemic to Ethiopia that cannot to some extent be regarded as endangered. This singular primate is unique in its feeds predominantly on grasses, and it is probably the most sociable of African monkeys, with conglobations of 500 or more regularly recorded in one field. It has a harm based social structure that is regarded to be the most complex of any animal other than human.

                In evolutionary terms, the gelada is something of a relic, the only surviving representative of a genus of grazing monkeys that once ranged far more broadly across Africa. The gelada stock is ancestral not only to the modern baboon that have largely displaced them in savanna and other open habitats, but also to the baboon like drills of west Africa and to the smaller and more arboreal mangabeys, both of which readapted to the rain forest habitats.
                
                This endemic species is distributed throughout the northern highlands, where it is generally associated with cliffs and ravines, and one can see them as soon as he/she over landed in the Simien Mountains National Park, which forms the species&#39 main stronghold, and they are also numerous on the Gussa Plateau. They are often seen in the vicinity of Ankober, Debre Sina, Debre Libanos and the Muga River gorge near Addis Ababa.
